# TaskManager_CLI

This programme is being created as part of my Java training. It is To-Do-List type of application with Command Line Interface. It will:  
* read .csv file with tasks,  
* save new tasks,  
* delete task that have already been done,  
* and even have colorful text to please user's eyes. ðŸ˜¯
